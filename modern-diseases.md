# Modern diseases

The cause of almost all modern diseases are inflammation, oxidative stress
and malnutrition (which includes high calorie malnutrition).

It's impossible to isolate a single factor as having a single cause—rather it's
like: "ABCDEF interact together to cause all of XYZÅÄÖ". To think that you can
find "the silver bullet" is mostly masturbatory thinking. This is what Western
medicine aims at, but it's misguided.

Treating depression, anxiety, asthma, eczema, diabetes, allergy, and so on, must
begin with removing inflammatory factors from your life and introducing
regenerative ones instead. Start here:

- [Nutrition](nutrition.md)
- [Gut health](misc.md#gut-brain-axis--gut-microbiota)
- [Breathing](breathing.md)
- Daily sunlight exposure or at least going for walks outside

Some more specific pointers:

### Myopia

- [FAQ for vision improvement by Hormetism](https://gettingstronger.org/2016/03/faq-for-vision-improvement-by-hormetism/)
- Avoid [blue light](modern-dangers.md#blue-light) as much as possible
  - Use a blue light filter such as [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)
  - Spend time in sunlight

### Asthma, anxiety

- Nosebreathing 24/7
- Daily Buteyko breathing exercises

### Depression, anxiety, eczema

- Nutrition and gut health
- Daily natural light exposure

### Hair loss and graying

Consider that in all animals except humans, hair loss is a sign of disease.

Being genetically predisposed to hair loss doesn't mean it has to happen.
In fact, you can slow, stop, or even reverse hair loss by preventing oxidative
stress, inflammation, mineral dysregulation, and consequent hormonal
dysregulation, which are all factors driving hair loss.

The causes of the above are multiple. Lifestyle stress is a significant factor
and should be avoided to the best of your ability. However keep in mind that
if you improve your diet (see my [nutrition page](nutrition.md)) you
will in turn improve your ability to handle stress.
