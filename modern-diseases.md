# Modern diseases

The cause of almost all modern diseases are inflammation, oxidative stress
and malnutrition (which includes high calorie malnutrition).

It's impossible to isolate a single factor as having a single cause—rather it's
like: "ABCDEF interact together to cause all of XYZÅÄÖ". To think that you can
find "the silver bullet" is mostly masturbatory thinking. This is what Western
medicine aims at, but it's misguided.

Treating depression, anxiety, asthma, eczema, diabetes, allergy, and so on, must
begin with removing inflammatory factors from your life and introducing
regenerative ones instead. Start here:

- [Nutrition](nutrition.md)
- [Gut health](misc.md#gut-brain-axis--gut-microbiota)
- [Breathing](breathing.md)
- Daily sunlight exposure or at least going for walks outside
