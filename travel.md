# Travel

Some might say that traveling abroad for leisure is an indulgent activity,
that it's not "trad", that it's immoral (ask yourself why they would say that),
that it's a sympton of the spirituo-geographical rootlessness so pervasive
across the modern world. Maybe they're right, and maybe you agree, and as
such maybe traveling isn't for you.

Now that that's over with, let's move on to some practicalities...

## Packing

Being smart with packing is key to enjoying a trip, be it 3 days, 3 weeks or
3 months long.

Limit yourself to one bag, preferably a backpack if you're going to be walking
and moving around a lot. Follow the advice from either of these pages:

- [/r/onebag wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/wiki/index)
- [onebag.com](https://www.onebag.com/)

Why pack light? From the onebag.com page:

- Security – you can always keep your single bag on you
- Economy – no need to check luggage or pay for transport for walkable distances
- Mobility – you're never held back by heavy luggage
- Serenity – less stuff to lose, easy to pack and unpack

### Minimum viable packing list

Here follows a very minimal packing list. In general you don't _need_ more than
this, but you should of course adjust for climate, comfort, and niche needs.
So if you're going to a beach town obviously also pack swimwear, duh (or better
yet, find shorts that double as swimwear). If you're a photographer bring your
camera. And so on.

- Clothing (each bullet point includes the worn item):
  - 3 x Shirts
  - 3 x Underwear
  - 3 x Socks
  - 1 x Pants
  - 1 x Shoes
  - Adjust layers according to climate
- Technology & Entertainment
  - Phone – for GPS, ongoing trip planning and connecting with people you meet
  - Earbuds – not essential, I like to be part of the surroundings
  - Book or E-reader – good for long transports
  - Necessary chargers
- Documents
  - Wallet + Cash
  - Passport
  - Small pen – always useful
  - Small notebook – optional
- Hygiene & misc
  - Dry bag _or_ sink stopper – see [Laundry](#laundry) section
  - Clothesline – ditto
  - Eye mask
  - Ear plugs
  - Toothbrush

Toothpaste, soap and other hygiene articles can be bought at the destination or
brought with you, it's up to you.

And you don't need sunglasses or sunscreen. See my page on
[Modern dangers](modern-dangers.md).

**But how am I supposed to survive with only three sets of clothing?**

As you will see, my friend, it is achievable if you just do your laundry during
your daily shower! One set of clothing to wear, one to clean and dry, and one
as a buffer for the occasion when you manage to get lucky with a ladyboy and
as such become unable to do laundry that night. See the next section...

### Laundry

The dead sinple way to clean is to use a dry bag, 5-10L in size. You simply pour
some shampoo or shower gel into it, then some hot/warm water until it lathers,
put clothes inside, shake around, let sit for 10 minutes or more if really
dirty. Empty and rinse in the shower or sink. Usually underwear and socks are
easier to wash by hand directly, and then you don't need more than a 5L dry bag.
Don't worry, this method _does_ in fact clean your clothes very well.

Hang your clothes to dry overnight or during the day, using hangers or the
lightweight clothesline you brought with you.

If you are lazy, have more clothes with you and are in a country where laundry
service is cheap, you can have it done for you for the equivalent of 1-2 USD
per kg.

## Being social

Traveling alone and want to have fun and meet people? Stay in a hostel that has
good reviews (and reviews that mention a "social atmosphere") and you'll be able
to meet people from all over the world. But do bring ear plugs and an eye mask.

Want to connect and make friends with locals? Learn the basics of their language
or at least some phrases such as "good day", "thank you", etc. It will really
make people open up.
