## Introduction

Following the guidelines in this document should fix most major nutritional
deficiencies and decrease inflammation â€“ but do your own research, adjust to
your own needs.

Keep in mind that the source of your food matters. Also, usually there are
alternatives to the items below that are local to your country or culture.
If so, try to eat that. Eat like your ancestors have done for thousands of
years, if possible.

Use a service like [cronometer.com](https://cronometer.com) to figure out
