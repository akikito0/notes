## Introduction

Following the guidelines in this document should fix most major nutritional
deficiencies and decrease inflammation – but do your own research, adjust to
your own needs.

Keep in mind that the source of your food matters. Also, usually there are
alternatives to the items below that are local to your country or culture.
If so, try to eat that. Eat like your ancestors have done for thousands of
years, if possible.

Use a service like [cronometer.com](https://cronometer.com) to figure out
potential deficiencies.

## What to eat

### Food

- **Meat** - game, grass-fed red meats, poultry
- **Seafood** - fish, shellfish, bivalves
- **Liver** - limit to 300-500g per week
- **Egg** - raw yolk, cooked white
- **Egg** - raw, [do not mix with sugars](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1285170461165277187)
- **Sauerkraut** - gut health
- **Kefir** - gut health
- **Milk** - preferably unpasteurized, high fat, possibly even goat milk if locally available
- **Fruit**
  - No smoothies or juices; we are made to consume fruits _whole_.
  - Choose fruits depending on what micronutrients you are lacking in your
    diet. For instance, citrus fruits are high in vitamin C, pineapple is high
    in vitamin C and manganese.

### Fats/oils

- **Butter** - for cooking
- **Tallow** - for cooking
- **Extra virgin coconut oil (EVCO)** - for cooking
- **Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)** - for cooking, but heat carefully
- **Black seed oil** - not for cooking; see below
- **Flax seed oil** - not for cooking

### Supplements

Not all of these are "necessary" and many can be obtained in good doses from
food. Magnesium is the most important one to supplement.

Meat contains all essential amino acids. Bone broth is high in collagen and thus
glycine. Glutamine will repair your gut lining—good if you suffer from IBS.
Salt your food liberally. Eat liver and wild caught seafood.

- **Magnesium** - 11 mg elemental magnesium per kg of bodyweight
  - Magnesium glycinate pills
  - Magnesium chloride (hexahydrate), sometimes called bittern or nigari salt
    - 12% elemental magnesium by weight.
    - Orally: 5-10 g dissolved in water per day (spread out). You can mask
      the taste with a splash of apple cider vinegar.
    - Topically: dissolve 100-200 g in 0.5L spray bottle, apply on skin.
    - [Some info](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1131597125245067264).
- **Glycine** - recovery, sleep depth, vivid dreams; supplement or eat bone broth
- **Glutamine** - gut health
- **Boron** - 3-5 mg daily, or 10 mg 3 days a week
- **Sodium chloride** - rock salt, (Celtic) sea salt; [be mindful of source](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/08/sea-salt-around-world-contaminated-by-plastic-studies)
- **Potassium chloride**
- **Creatine** - for performance, [well researched](https://examine.com/supplements/creatine/)
- **Black Seed Oil** - [research](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1254703513134751746); [buy on iHerb](https://www.iherb.com/pr/Heritage-Store-Black-Seed-Oil-16-fl-oz-480-ml/71956)

**A note on supplements:** There are some commonly used supplements I will
**not** recommend, because I have read conflicting material on them and their
use is not supported by time and tradition. I'm not recommending against the
minerals/vitamins themselves, only against them being supplemented. They are:

- **Vitamin C** - See [here](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1291086529163534336).
  Get vitamin C from fruit and liver, _not_ as ascorbic acid or citric acid.
- **Vitamin D3** - Increases calcium, depletes magnesium, potassium and retinol.
  Get vitamin D from sunlight and seafood, eggs and cod liver [oil] instead.
- **Iron** - All supplements and plant sources of iron have low bioavailability,
  and thus accumulates in your blood to a greater extent than heme iron. Avoid
  [iron](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Agrimhood%20free%20iron&src=typed_query)
  supplements and get your iron from meat. Also see the section about iron in
  the [modern dangers](modern-dangers.md#non-bioavailable-copper-and-iron) page.
- **Omega-3** - Capsules / fish oil easily turns rancid. Get omega-3 (DHA/EPA)
  from seafood and bivalves, preferably wild caught.
- **Zinc** - Creates copper/iron imbalance. Get zinc from red meat and bivalves.

### Miscellaneous

- **Raw apple cider vinegar (with "mother")** - antioxidant, antimicrobial
- **Raw honey** - anti-allergenic, and more; do not heat
- **Lemon** - immunity
- **Ginger** - immunity
- **Cayenne** - I heard this is good, but do your own research
- **Turmeric** - same as above
- **Garlic, [garlic skin broth](https://skillet.lifehacker.com/use-papery-garlic-skins-to-give-broth-big-flavor-1797726954)** - immunity
- **Red onion** - with food
- **Raw beetroot juice** - iron, folate, antioxidants, and more.
  - **Note!** Beets contain non-heme iron (bad), but at the same time they
    serve an important role in traditional cuisine, especially in Europe,
    and have other benefits.
  - Put raw beetroot and water in blender, filter through fine strainer.
