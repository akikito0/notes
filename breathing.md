### How to do Buteyko breathing

1. **Normal Breath In Through Nose**.<br>
   Sit down in an upright posture and take a normal, calm breath through your nose. Do not take a deep breath.
2. **Normal Breath Out Through Nose**.<br>
   Exhale as you normally would through your nose. Use the diaphragm to push all air out of the lungs (stomach should move, chest should not).
3. **Shorter Breath In Through Nose**.<br>
   Now, take a shorter, more shallow and light (~1-2 seconds) inhalation through the nose and stop.
4. **Long Breath Out Through Nose**.<br>
   Slowly release the breath over 5 seconds, using your diaphragm to empty out your lungs. Hold breath after complete exhale for 5 seconds.
5. **Repeat Steps 1-4**.<br>
   Take a normal, calm breath again through the nose (step 1), and repeat the entire process for several minutes.

- 2-3 x 15-20 minutes per day.
- 80%-90% Inhale - Slow Exhale (2s) - Xs pause
- Adjust X (0-20+) to maintain:
  - Light Air Hunger / Moderate Air Hunger / Strong Air Hunger
  - Start with LAH for the first 2 weeks. Focus on relaxation.
- This is the RF (Reduced Frequency) [#Buteyko](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Buteyko?src=hashtag_click) method.
- Do it on an empty stomach
- Wait 1-2 hours between each session
- Make sure you're not overheating
- Exhale by relaxing the respiratory muscle (SUPER IMPORTANT!)
- Nosebreathing obviously
- You can do up to 3 hours if you wish
- Combine this with "BreatheLess Walking"
- The goal is to raise your Control Pause (CP).
  - Test before and after (wait 5 minutes after the session). If you've done the exercise right, your CP should've been raised by 2-3 seconds at least (more like 6-10s).
