# Miscellaneous notes

Stuff I don't know where else to put for now.

## Drink warm water, not cold

Cold water (especially with ice) restricts blood vessels lining the gut,
increases mucus production, and neutralizes digestive enzymes. Warm or lukewarm
water is better for digestion and nutrient absorption.

This is supported by tradition, for instance the Chinese and the Ayurvedic.

There's also some research on it:

- [_Effects of drinking hot water, cold water, and chicken soup on nasal mucus velocity and nasal airflow resistance_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/359266/)
- [_Effects of hot tea, coffee and water ingestion on physiological responses and mood: the role of caffeine, water and beverage type_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002130050438?LI=true)
- [_Water ingestion increases sympathetic vasoconstrictor discharge in normal human subjects_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11222121/)
- [_Response of esophagus to high and low temperatures in patients with achalasia_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23105999/)

Try to have warm with your food instead and see for yourself.

## Sauerkraut

Here's how you make sauerkraut (fermented cabbage).

### **Ingredients:**

- 1 head of cabbage
- 2% sea salt by cabbage weight

### **Instructions:**

1. Prepare and clean as many glass jars as you think you'll need.
2. Chop or shred cabbage and rinse under cold water. Sprinkle with salt.
3. Knead the cabbage with clean hands for about 10 minutes until there is enough
   liquid to cover it.
4. Stuff the cabbage into a glass jar, pressing the cabbage underneath the
   liquid. If necessary, add a bit of water to completely cover the cabbage.
5. Cover the jar with a tight lid, airlock lid, or coffee filter secured with a
   rubber band.
6. Culture at room temperature (60-70°F is preferred) for at least 2 weeks,
   until desired flavor and texture is achieved. If using a tight lid, burp it
   daily to release excess pressure.
7. Once the sauerkraut is finished, put a tight lid on the jar and move to cold
   storage. The sauerkraut's flavor will continue to develop as it ages.

## Gut-brain axis & gut microbiota

Rather than me poorly trying to explain this, you'd do well to research this
on your own. I will just point you in the right direction.

There's considerable research indicating that there is a bidirectional
communication going on between your gut and your brain—this is termed the
_gut-brain axis_. In a healthy individual the gut and the brain work together
smoothly, but in an individual with gut dysbiosis this communication is
disrupted and all sorts of chronic diseases appear, including irritable bowel
syndrome, depression, autism spectrum disorder, irritable bowel syndrome,
Alzheimer's disease, other neuropsychiatric disorders, and chronic inflammation
in general.

Inside your gut, your intestines, live trillions of bacteria (microbiota).
Some of these have a parasitic relationship with you—hijacking your system for
their own gain at your expense—while others function symbiotically.

What you want to do is to stop introducting and feeding parasitic microbiota,
and start introducting and feeding symbiotic microbiota. This can be done in
a number of ways but the simplest one is via diet. In order to starve the former
I suggest following a diet similar to the one oulined [here](nutrition.md), and
in order to introduce the latter I suggest regularly eating probiotic food,
such as sauerkraut or kefir
([more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fermented_foods)). Just
beware of _pasteurized_ fermented foods; pasteurization kills most bacteria!
But assert the quality of the food and its preparation, don't get sick.

### Research

Do your own research and draw your own conclusions. Visit
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) or
[PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) (the latter has full text
articles) and search for e.g. "gut microbiota", "gut-brain axis", or any of
those two plus your subject of interest e.g. "gut microbiota depression".

I'll link a few interesting articles here below.
