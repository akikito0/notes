# Miscellaneous notes

Stuff I don't know where else to put for now.

## Drink warm water, not cold

Cold water (especially with ice) restricts blood vessels lining the gut,
increases mucus production, and neutralizes digestive enzymes. Warm or lukewarm
water is better for digestion and nutrient absorption.

This is supported by tradition, for instance the Chinese and the Ayurvedic.

There's also some research on it:

- [_Effects of drinking hot water, cold water, and chicken soup on nasal mucus velocity and nasal airflow resistance_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/359266/)
- [_Effects of hot tea, coffee and water ingestion on physiological responses and mood: the role of caffeine, water and beverage type_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002130050438?LI=true)
- [_Water ingestion increases sympathetic vasoconstrictor discharge in normal human subjects_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11222121/)
- [_Response of esophagus to high and low temperatures in patients with achalasia_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23105999/)

Try to have warm with your food instead and see for yourself.

## Sauerkraut

Here's how you make sauerkraut (fermented cabbage).

### **Ingredients:**

- 1 medium head of cabbage
- 1-3 tbsp. sea salt

### **Instructions:**

1. **Chop** or **shred** cabbage. **Sprinkle** with salt.
2. **Knead** the cabbage with clean hands, or **pound** with a potato masher
   about 10 minutes, until there is enough liquid to cover.
3. **Stuff** the cabbage into a quart jar, **pressing** the cabbage underneath
   the liquid. If necessary, add a bit of water to completely cover cabbage.
4. **Cover** the jar with a tight lid, airlock lid, or coffee filter secured
   with a rubber band.
5. **Culture** at room temperature (60-70°F is preferred) for
   **at least 2 weeks** until desired flavor and texture are achieved. If using
   a tight lid, **burp daily** to release excess pressure.
6. Once the sauerkraut is finished, **put a tight lid on the jar** and 
   **move to cold storage**. The sauerkraut's flavor will continue to develop
   as it ages.
