# Miscellaneous notes

Stuff I don't know where else to put for now.

## Drink warm water, not cold

Cold water (especially with ice) restricts blood vessels lining the gut,
increases mucus production, and neutralizes digestive enzymes. Warm or lukewarm
water is better for digestion and nutrient absorption.

This is supported by tradition, for instance the Chinese and the Ayurvedic.

There's also some research on it:

- [_Effects of drinking hot water, cold water, and chicken soup on nasal mucus velocity and nasal airflow resistance_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/359266/)
- [_Effects of hot tea, coffee and water ingestion on physiological responses and mood: the role of caffeine, water and beverage type_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002130050438?LI=true)
- [_Water ingestion increases sympathetic vasoconstrictor discharge in normal human subjects_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11222121/)
- [_Response of esophagus to high and low temperatures in patients with achalasia_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23105999/)

Try to have warm with your food instead and see for yourself.
