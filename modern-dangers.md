# Modern dangers

On this page you'll find notes about often overlooked long-term dangers in the
modern world.

Keep in mind that much of the advice below is only effective if you
follow my [nutrition advice](nutrition.md). For instance, if you avoid using
suncreen but your diet is shit, you will likely burn yourself.

## Blue light

Avoid [blue light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_effects_of_high-energy_visible_light)
from artificial light sources and monitors as much as possible.

- Blue light is a contributing factor in myopia (near-sightedness) and
  [macular degeneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration).
- Blue light can cause eye strain and headaches.
- Some [claim](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1301510180450959360) that
  high-energy blue light and lack of sunlight causes free iron to accumulate in
  and around your eyes, which is very bad. Some
  [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2718721/)
  on free iron and eye disease.
- Exposure to blue light at night inhibits melatonin production which disrupts
  your circadian rhythm and poor sleep, which leads to a number of health
  problems.
- There are likely many other negative effects of blue light that I don't feel
  confident mentioning here.

Avoid the damage caused by blue light by installing a blue light filter on your
computer and phone (such as [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)), avoiding screens
as much as possible, and getting plenty of sunlight.

**Research**

There's a lot of [research on blue light and eye damage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=blue+light+eye+damage),
check it out for yourself. Here are some articles:

- [_Removal of the blue component of light significantly decreases retinal damage after high intensity exposure_ (2018 Mar 15)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5854379/)

## Sunscreen

Do not use sunscreen.

Commercial sunscreen is full of endocrine disrupting chemicals that get absorbed
by your skin, and end up [accumulating in your body at high levels](https://www.pharmacist.com/article/sunscreen-chemicals-accumulate-body-high-levels).

But we don't even need to turn to science in order to reject sunscreen.
Commercial sunscreen has been around for less than 100 years which isn't
nearly enough time to learn about the long term effects.

**But what then instead?**

- Build up tolerance.
- Drink a lot of water.
- Wear a hat and protective clothing (such as light loose fitting shirt).
- Don't expose yourself for long periods of time; take frequent "breaks" from the sun.
- Avoid everything under the [What to avoid](nutrition.md#what-to-avoid) section
  on the Nutrition page. Most importantly
  [avoid PUFAs](https://twitter.com/SolBrah/status/1286086327427928064)
  (polyunsatured fatty acids).
- Use a natural sunscreen such as
  [zinc oxide](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1286091082397147136) paste
  or coconut oil.

## Sunglasses

Do not use sunglasses (unless you need them to drive safely).

You don't need them. They will just make your vision worse and weaken the
signals that enforce a healthy circadian rhythm. Also, they're antisocial.

## Shampoo

Do not use schampoo.

The sulfates in schampoo, while removing dirt from your hair and scalp, also
strip them of natural oils. This dries out your hair and makes it frizzy and
brittle.

Your scalp also absorbs whatever industrial chemicals the schampoo contains.

## Porn

Do not watch porn.

Do I even need to mention this one?

[In case you're not convinced](https://twitter.com/thuletide/status/1249437488579579905).

## Mouthbreathing

Mouthbreathing means using your mouth instead of your nose to breathe.
The habit usually begins as an infant and it causes a myriad of health problems
later on in life.

More extensive information is available on the [breathing page](breathing.md).
You might be mouthbreathing without being aware of it. Check out the page.

## Iron toxicity

Beware of consuming non-heme iron, found in many plant foods. It has a low
bioavailability, so most of it (from upward of 60%) gets stored in organs and
tissue as "labile iron" acting as a catalyst for oxidative damage to your
cells. This is what iron toxicity means.

Like pretty much everyone today, you probably have accumulated lots of such iron
over the years, especially if you are a male or a postmenopausal woman (if you
are a young woman, the monthly blood loss via menstruation helps remove free
labile iron, although iron toxicity is still a risk).

So what can you do?

Focus on getting more magnesium (which you need to supplement) and retinol
(_preformed_ vitamin A) and bioavailable copper, found mainly in animal fats
and foods. Liver is a great source of retinol and bioavailabel copper. These
work to remove excess iron from your body.
Also see the [nutrition](nutrition.md) page.

## Copper toxicity

I still need to research this subject. The gist of it is that iron toxicity
(see above) can lead to copper toxicity. Check out these links in the meantime:

## For women: contraceptive pills and IUDs

They cause copper-iron dyshomeostasis. See
[this thread](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1308544875332136960)
and what was retweeted.
