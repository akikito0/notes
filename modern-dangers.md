# Modern dangers

First, a few premises to keep in mind.

- Your skin absorbs what you put on it.
- Be wary of modern inventions.
- Much of the advice below is only effective if you already follow my [nutrition advice](nutrition.md). For instance, if you avoid using suncreen but your diet is shit, you will likely burn yourself.

## Sunscreen

Do not use sunscreen.

Commercial sunscreen is full of endocrine disrupting chemicals that get absorbed
by your skin, and end up[accumulating in your body at high levels](https://www.pharmacist.com/article/sunscreen-chemicals-accumulate-body-high-levels).

But we don't even need to turn to science in order to reject sunscreen.
Commercial sunscreen has been around for less than 100 years which isn't
nearly enough time to learn about the long term effects.

**But what then instead?**

- Build up tolerance.
- Drink a lot of water.
- Wear a hat and protective clothing (such as light loose fitting shirt).
- Don't expose yourself for long periods of time; take frequent "breaks" from the sun.
- Avoid everything under the [What to avoid](nutrition.md#what-to-avoid) section
  on the Nutrition page. Most importantly
  [avoid PUFAs](https://twitter.com/SolBrah/status/1286086327427928064)
  (polyunsatured fatty acids).
- Use a natural sunscreen such as
  [zinc oxide](https://twitter.com/Grimhood/status/1286091082397147136) paste
  or coconut oil.

## Sunglasses

Do not use sunglasses (unless you need them to drive safely).

You don't need them. They will just make your vision worse and weaken the
signals that enforce a healthy circadian rhythm. Also, they're antisocial.

## Shampoo

Do not use schampoo.

The sulfates in schampoo, while removing dirt from your hair and scalp, also
strip them of natural oils. This dries out your hair and makes it frizzy and
brittle.

Your scalp also absorbs whatever industrial chemicals the schampoo contains.

## Porn

Do not watch porn.

It makes you a cuck and a voyeur. It puts you into the role of passive observer.

## Non-bioavailable copper and iron

## For women: contraceptive pills and IUDs

They cause copper-iron dyshomeostasis. See
